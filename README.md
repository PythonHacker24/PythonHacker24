# What am I working on?

![Copy of White Minimalist Profile LinkedIn Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fbadf25-ae8b-4df8-8683-31b62e20c3c0)

I am actively building Stockic, a startup that is solving the problem of getting insights from finance news to help you make better decisions right in your palm. 

Join the waitlist: https://getwaitlist.com/waitlist/23342

We cut the fluff out of the news and provide the information you need to make better financial decisions quickly. 

Fun Fact: To understand the impact of getting to-the-point insights and the effects of fluff on your brain, I self-studied parts of neuroscience - There is so much work that needs to be put into removing distractions from news apps and providing data-driven insights. 

It's an AI startup - I am wandering around, meeting people, and searching for VCs to fund this revolution.
